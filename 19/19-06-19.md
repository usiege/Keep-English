# Would you buy a computer secondhand?

Hello, my name is Mark. And my name is Sorie.

大家好，我是马克。我是索瑞。

Today's question is would you buy a computer secondhand? I would. Definitely. I don't mind if it's new or old, as long as it works. I'm not picky. How about you?

今天要讨论的问题是，你会买二手电脑吗？我会。我肯定会。只要电脑能用，我不介意是新的还是二手的。我并不挑剔，你呢？

Definitely. I'm not picky either. I don't see why I wouldn't buy a computer secondhand. Right.

我也肯定会买，我也不挑剔。我不明白为什么不买二手电脑。对。

Can you foresee any problems, though? I don't think so. And they are cheap, so I think it's really good. Yeah.

要是有问题呢？我认为不会，二手电脑很便宜，我认为已经够好了。

So basically, we think that buying a computer secondhand has no possible problems. No.

基本上来说，我们两个人都认为买二手电脑不太可能出现问题。对。
