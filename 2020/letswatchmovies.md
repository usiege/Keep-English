My favorite animation "Heaven office's blessing" was put on yesterday. I wait it for a year.

Brave heart.

A drama is a play, film, or television program that 
has a strong plot and is usually based on a true story
or real-life situation.

I do watch horror movies. Maybe the things that happen 
in hrror movies do happen in real life, but I do not know.

Would you agree to your whole life being documented?
keep calm. ---> calm down
