# Whenever I try to fix things, I get angry

Carry on.

No, I don't need to fix things.
I always fix my own computer at work.

When do you get angry?
I stop coding and have a rest.
I take a big breath.
When my brother provokes me I get angry.
I beat him.

I sing whatever I want. I sing anything I want.
Hang your coat wherever. Hang your coat anywhere.

I play with some internet friends.
badminton

Give it to try!
I can fix it whenever I need to.

You should be patient whoever you are talking.

Whenever I need to relax I dance.
