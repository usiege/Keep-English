# Breaking Bad Habits 改掉坏习惯(2)

Fascinating. Let's say you want to give up sugar, or you want to give up smoking or something like that, a physical substance. Do you have any tips for that?
有意思。比如说想戒掉糖，或是想戒烟之类的，戒掉一种物质。对此你有什么建议吗？

Yes. One of their easiest things to do is incorporate fermented foods that break up chemical dependency on sugars, alcohol, and some other addictive substances.
好。其中一个最简单的方法是食用发酵食品， 以分解对糖、酒精和其他上瘾物质的化学依赖。

When I work with people who are recovering from any kind of addictions, they don't have to be substance addictions, fermented foods help a lot. Okay. Can you give some examples of fermented foods?
不一定是物质上瘾，我在帮助那些患有各种上瘾症的人康复时，发酵食品很管用。好。你能说明一下哪些属于发酵食品吗？

Absolutely. If you just chop up any kind of vegetable, let's say it's cabbage and carrot, so you cut it up. You massage it with salt and some spices until their juice comes out.
当然可以。你可以将任何蔬菜切碎，比如说卷心菜和胡萝卜，把它们切碎。然后放入盐和一些调料搅拌，直到它们的汁液出来。

You press it down so all the vegetables are covered with its own juice. Three days later, you have perfect fermented sauerkraut. Wow, that's great. Could you just buy sauerkraut or vinegar or something like that? Would that work?
接下来按一按，让所有蔬菜都泡在汁液里。三天之后，你就会得到完美的发酵泡菜。哇哦，真不错。买的那些泡菜或醋可以吗？那有用吗？

Well, unfortunately, it wouldn't, because most of their krauts that you buy is pasteurized, which does not give you their probiotic activity. A lot of it is fake sauerkraut.
很不幸，那没用，因为市面上销售的大多数泡菜都经过了杀菌，那不能给身体提供益生菌活性。许多泡菜是假的。

What I mean by that, if there was no bacterial activity and their taste comes from vinegar, you do not get this benefit. Wow, that's good to know.
我的意思是，如果没有细菌活性，那它们的味道都来自于醋，那不能达到效果。哇哦，幸好知道了这些。

I think though part of the problem though is even myself thinking like, Oh, I'm not going to cut up a bunch of cabbage and carrots, and wait three days.
我认为这存在一些问题，就连我自己都认为，“哦，我不会把一推卷心菜和胡萝卜切碎，更何况还得等三天”。

It seems like it's too much work. Well, it might be. Maybe you can visit a friend who is doing that, or if you have access to farmer's market or some natural organic stores,
那看起来工作量很大。嗯，可能吧。也许你可以去拜访会这样做的朋友，或是去农贸市场或天然有机产品商店，

they may provide something that is not pasteurized and prepared the right way. Oh, that's a good idea. Okay, well, thanks a lot. That was some really good advice.
那里可能有未经杀菌的食物，而且可以按照正确的方式制作发酵食品。哦，这个主意不错。好，非常谢谢你。这些真是非常好的建议。
Very welcome.
不客气。
