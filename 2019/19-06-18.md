# 西班牙加泰罗尼亚前总统的"逃亡生活"

I miss my family, I miss my country but actually I am fleeing also at home, living in the capital of Europe. But let me put the other side to you.
我想念我的家人，也想念我的国家，但是其实我住在欧洲首都的家里的时候，也处于逃亡状态。但是我想谈谈从这件事的另一面来说，你是怎样的。

Oriol Junqueras, your former vice-president spoke to reporter and said for him, the ethical moral duty was to stay. I wonder whether you believe he has a point?
你的“前副总统”奥里奥·朱克拉斯对记者说，对于他来说，道义上的责任是留在国内。我想知道，你是否觉得他说的有道理？

But I didn't choose to live comfortable and escaping of any kind of risk and disappear from the scenario. No. I did it to put a bigger scenario than ever, and to transform the Catalan crisis into an international or mainly a European issue.
但是我没有选择逃离任何危险，去过舒舒服服的生活，我没有从当前的形势中消失。没有。我其实是摆了一个比以前更大的棋局，我把加泰罗尼亚的危机转变成了一个国际事件、或者说主要是一个欧洲事件。

The parliament approved the declaration of independence. That it clear, but the parliament has its duty is to approve laws and political declarations.
议会批准了宣告加泰罗尼亚独立。这是明白无误的，但是议会的责任就是批准法律和宣布决定。

And the duty of the government is to execute that. And obviously we didn't execute the mandatory of the Catalan parliament, but that declarations is there.
而政府的责任是执行议会的决定。很显然我们没有执行加泰罗尼亚议会的命令，但是议会还是宣布了加泰罗尼亚独立。

Do you think a lot and wrestle with your own conscience and regret perhaps not calling elections and doing something else and not having parliament declare independence?
你有没有在这件事上想很多，良心上会挣扎，后悔比如怎么没有举行公投， 做一些其他的事情，而不是让议会宣告加泰罗尼亚独立？

Well, my regret is on the 10th of October, when it was expected at that day to declare independence of Catalonia and I decide to suspend the effects of declaration.
我是在10月10号开始后悔的，这天是加泰罗尼亚准备宣告独立的日子，我决定要中止独立宣告的效力。
I think clearly that was a mistake. We find two electronic devices under our two cars.
我想得很清楚，这是一个错误的决定。在我们两辆车的下面，发现了两个电子装置。
