Do you read food labels? 你看食品标签吗?

And my name is Sorie, and today's question is. . . Do you read food labels?
我是索瑞，今天要讨论的问题是……你看食品标签吗？

I don't really, but my father used to read food labels and I used to hate going shopping with him because I had to wait for hours until he finished reading the labels.
我不看，不过我爸爸经常看食品标签，我以前很讨厌和他一起去购物， 因为我不得不等他看完食品标签，而那要花费好几个小时。

Yeah. How about you? I I read food labels. Yeah. If I don't read the food label, I don't know what's in the food. Is that not a problem for you?
你呢？我看食品标签。如果我不看食品标签，我就不知道食品中包含哪些物质。对你来说这不是问题吗？

I guess it is, but I guess I trust the people that make the food. But what do you think? Should I not trust the people that make our food anymore?
我想是问题，不过我相信生产食品的厂商。你怎么看？我不应该继续相信那些制造食品的厂商吗？

You should trust them, but maybe there are things in the food that you don't want to go into your body. That's a really interesting topic.
你应该相信他们，但是可能食品中含有你不想身体摄入的物质。这真是个有意思的观点。

Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll start reading the labels from now on.
对。嗯，我想我会从现在开始看食品标签。

I think you should. Thank you.
我认为你应该这样做。谢谢。
